# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: 12 Jan 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
My AWS account was fully enabled today. So, my objective was to enable my cloud-based IDE for Rails development, per the Coder-Manual guidelines. I was able to complete the IDE setup and ran a test rails application and server.
Step 0: On AWS as a root user, I used AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control access to your AWS account:
      -> Created 2 new groups (users, admins) for AWS Cloud9
      -> Created 1 new user id and 1 new admin id
      -> Assigned users to their respective groups. 
      -> Add AWS Cloud9 Access Permissions to each Group
Step 1: Sign in to the AWS Cloud9 Console using the newly created user id
Step 2: Checked rails and ruby versions via the IDE
Step 3: Built a test rails app 
Step 4: Once test app worked, deleted the test app

**Thoughts**: Looking forward to tomorrow.

**Link(s) to work**: Also created a new Twitter account, specifically to track web development and my 100 day challenge

### Day 1: 11 Jan 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Found my access to Coder Manual: Complete Web Developer Bootcamp with Rails. I wanted to have real world projects for this challenge, as well as creating my own portfolio. I watched a few videos, and I am waiting for my AWS environment to launch. I should be able to create some tangible content tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: As a side note, I thought about signing up for CodeAcademy Pro course, which cost several hundred dollars. Since I already paid for the bootcamp, I wanted to try it first. I can always adjust my start date of the challenge once I get my dev environment set.
