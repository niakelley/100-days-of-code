# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 10 Jan 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Worked on FreeAcademy coursework and stored the code for a NYFW fashion blog page. 
2. Set up my dev enviroment - notepad++, github desktop, dracula dark theme.

**Thoughts:** I'm trying to figure out the ultimate goal regarding my personal progress. Ultimately, I want to progress to becoming a full-stack developer. I am trying to refresh my dev skills. I would rather have a project description and work towards them independantly, as opposed to being taken them step-by-step.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
