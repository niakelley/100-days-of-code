# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 11 Jan 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Found my access to Coder Manual: Complete Web Developer Bootcamp with Rails. I wanted to have real world projects for this challenge, as well as creating my own portfolio. I watched a few videos, and I am waiting for my AWS environment to launch. I should be able to create some tangible content tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: As a side note, I thought about signing up for CodeAcademy Pro course, which cost several hundred dollars. Since I already paid for the bootcamp, I wanted to try it first. I can always adjust my start date of the challenge once I get my dev environment set.
